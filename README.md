**Wendy Elvira-GarcÃ­a, PhD**  
Iâ€™m a phonetician and assistant professor (tenure-eligible Serra HÃºnter Fellow) at the University of Barcelona, I am also head of the Phonetics Laboratory and I serve as editor-in-chief of the Diamond Open Access journal Estudios de FonÃ©tica Experimental.

My research focuses on variation and clinical phonetics. I have created tools for clinical and forensic acoustic analysis, including an automatic transcriber of Spanish and Catalan intonation, and software for calculating prosodic distances across linguistic varieties (dialectometry). I also love to help to design linguistic databases and record data.

- ðŸ’» I program mainly in Praat and R (Python if I need it) and love Open Science. In a past life I used Matlab quite a lot. 
- ðŸ’¬ I work on Catalan, Spanish and occasionally on other Romance languages (such as Asturian, Rumantsch, Sardinian...).
- ðŸŽ“ I teach Phonetics, Phonology, Laboratory Phonology, occasionally NLP related courses and any kind of Introductions to Linguistics.
- ðŸ“« Find my at my [personal webpage](https://www.ub.edu/phoneticslaboratory/sites/wendyelvira/), the [labâ€™s website](https://www.ub.edu/phoneticslaboratory), and here in GitHub.
- ðŸ’… If my nails or makeup donâ€™t match my clothes, Iâ€™m really stressed out.
