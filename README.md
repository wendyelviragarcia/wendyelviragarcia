**Wendy Elvira-GarcÃ­a, PhD**  
Assistant Professor (Serra HÃºnter Fellow)  
University of Barcelona, Spain  

I am a phonetician and assistant professor (tenure-eligible Serra HÃºnter fellow) at the University of Barcelona,and head of the Phonetics Laboratory, I am also editor-in-chief of the Diamond Open Access journal *Estudios de FonÃ©tica Experimental*.  

My research focuses on clinical phonetics and phonetic variation. I have created tools for clinical and forensic acoustic analysis, including an automatic transcriber of Spanish and Catalan intonation, and software for calculating prosodic distances across linguistic varieties (dialectometry). I also love to help to design linguistic databases and record data.

- ðŸ’¬ I work on Catalan, Spanish and occasionally on other Romance languages (such as Asturian, Rumantsch, Sardinian...).
